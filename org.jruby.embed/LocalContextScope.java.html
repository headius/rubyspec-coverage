/**
 * LocalContextState defines four scopes to maintain {@link LocalContext}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * A single {@link ScriptingContainer} can be configured to act as a facade for multiple {@link Ruby} runtimes
 * (or really multiple Ruby VMs, since each {@link Ruby} instance is a Ruby &quot;VM&quot;), and this enum controls
 * that behaviour. (this behaviour is bit like that of {@link ThreadLocal} &amp;mdash; it changes its behaviour
 * silently depending on the calling thread, an act of multiplexing.)
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * When you think of this multiplexing behaviour, there are two sets of states that need separate attention.
 * One is {@link Ruby} instance, which represents the whole VM, classes, global variables, etc. Then
 * there's {@linkplain ScriptingContainer#getAttributeMap() attributes} and so-called
 * {@linkplain ScriptingContainer#getVarMap() variables}, which are really a special scope induced by the
 * scripting container for better JSR-223 interop.
 * In this documentation, we refer to the former as &quot;the runtime&quot; and the latter as &quot;the variables&quot;,
 * but the variables shouldn't be confused with the global variables in Ruby's semantics, which belongs
 * to the runtime.

     * When any singleton-based scripting container is torn down ({@link ScriptingContainer#terminate()}), the global runtime will also
     * be torn down and cleared. Subsequent singleton containers will see a new runtime.
